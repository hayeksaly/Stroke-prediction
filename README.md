# Stroke-prediction
Stroke prediction of a client based on many features using deep learning.
This project was a challenge of the week project by a company named Zaka. My job was to preprocess the data,
clean it, visualize it and based on the features using deep learning methods(find best parameters using Grid Search
-hyperparameters) to create the model able to predict if the person had stroke, and evaluate it.
